# Loop Subdivision
This package performs loop subdivision on a given triangular mesh saved in .off mesh format.
For the construction of triangular mesh from a given .off file, the **halfedge_mesh** package in 
https://github.com/carlosrojas/halfedge_mesh.git is used. 

# Usage
To perform the loop subdivision: 
1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/k1majd/loop_subdivison.git
```
2. Store your .off file in `loop_subdivison/Subdivision/Python/halfedge_mesh/tests/data/`
